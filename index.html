    (async () =>  const x = 1\"\") for easy reference when creating diffs or discussing code. Supports text extraction from PDF and DOCX files, but may not handle other binary files properly. **IMPORTANT: You can read a maximum of 5 files in a single request.** If you need to read more files, use multiple sequential read_file requests. Parameters: - args: Contains one or more file elements, where each file contains: - path: (required) File path (relative to workspace directory c:\\Users\\ALT1\\Downloads\\roocode) Usage: <read_file> <args> <file> <path>path/to/file</path> </file> </args> </read_file> Examples: 1. Reading a single file: <read_file> <args> <file> <path>src/app.ts</path> </file> </args> </read_file> 2. Reading multiple files (within the 5-file limit): <read_file> <args> <file> <path>src/app.ts</path> </file> <file> <path>src/utils.ts</path> </file> </args> </read_file> 3. Reading an entire file: <read_file> <args> <file> <path>config.json</path> </file> </args> </read_file> IMPORTANT: You MUST use this Efficient Reading Strategy: - You MUST read all related files and implementations together in a single operation (up to 5 files at once) - You MUST obtain all necessary context before proceeding with changes - When you need to read more than 5 files, prioritize the most critical files first, then use subsequent read_file requests for additional files ## fetch_instructions Description: Request to fetch instructions to perform a task Parameters: - task: (required) The task to get instructions for. This can take the following values: create_mcp_server create_mode Example: Requesting instructions to create an MCP Server <fetch_instructions> <task>create_mcp_server</task> </fetch_instructions> ## search_files Description: Request to perform a regex search across files in a specified directory, providing context-rich results. This tool searches for patterns or specific content across multiple files, displaying each match with encapsulating context. Parameters: - path: (required) The path of the directory to search in (relative to the current workspace directory c:\\Users\\ALT1\\Downloads\\roocode). This directory will be recursively searched. - regex: (required) The regular expression pattern to search for. Uses Rust regex syntax. - file_pattern: (optional) Glob pattern to filter files (e.g., \'*.ts\' for TypeScript files). If not provided, it will search all files (*). Usage: <search_files> <path>Directory path here</path> <regex>Your regex pattern here</regex> <file_pattern>file pattern here (optional)</file_pattern> </search_files> Example: Requesting to search for all .ts files in the current directory <search_files> <path>.</path> <regex>.*</regex> <file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern> </search_files> ## list_files Description: Request to list files and directories within the specified directory. If recursive is true, it will list all files and directories recursively. If recursive is false or not provided, it will only list the top-level contents. Do not use this tool to confirm the existence of files you may have created, as the user will let you know if the files were created successfully or not. Parameters: - path: (required) The path of the directory to list contents for (relative to the current workspace directory c:\\Users\\ALT1\\Downloads\\roocode) - recursive: (optional) Whether to list files recursively. Use true for recursive listing, false or omit for top-level only. Usage: <list_files> <path>Directory path here</path> <recursive>true or false (optional)</recursive> </list_files> Example: Requesting to list all file User: <task> проверка </task> <environment_details> # VSCode Visible Files # VSCode Open Tabs # Current Time Current time in ISO 8601 UTC format: 2025-09-16T00:35:00.251Z User time zone: Europe/Moscow, UTC+3:00 # Current Cost $0.00 # Current Mode <slug>code</slug> <name> Code</name> <model>sqlite-model</model> # Current Workspace Directory (c:/Users/ALT1/Downloads/roocode) Files .qodo/ You have not created a todo list yet. Create one with \`update_todo_list\` if your task is complicated or involves multiple steps. </environment_details>\"', model: 'claude-sonnet-4', stream: true );
